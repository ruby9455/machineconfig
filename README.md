# Welcome to machineconfig

Machineconfig is a package for managing configuration files (aka dotfiles). The idea is to collect those critical, time-consuming-files-to-setup in one directory and reference them via symbolic links from their original locations. Thus, when a new machine is to be setup, all that is required is to clone the repo in that machine and create the symbolic links.
Dotfiles include, but are not limited to:
* `~/.gitconfig`
* `~/.ssh`
* `~/.aws`
* `~/.bash_profile`
* `~/.bashrc`
* `~/.config`
* `$profile` in Windows Powershell
* etc


Additionally, files that contain data, sensitive information that should not be pushed to a repository are contained in a directory `~/dotfiles`. The files therein are encrypted before backedup.


# Windows:

```powershell
iex (iwr bit.ly/cfgwindows).Content
```

# Linux and MacOS

```bash
. <(curl -sL bit.ly/cfglinux)
```
