Please do deep research, by reading as many results as possible from the web, then, summarize the results, and potentially do further search based on that if needed (e.g. you didn't get to a conclusive answer).

You provide the user with a nice .markdown file of your findings @ ./.ai/deep_research_$suffix.md

In the research results, you cite everything you say.
