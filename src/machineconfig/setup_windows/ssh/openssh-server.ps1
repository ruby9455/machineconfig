# to install: winget install --Id Microsoft.OpenSSH.Preview --source winget --scope user  # from: https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Install-Win32-OpenSSH
# the result is installed in C:\Program Files\OpenSSH as opposed to C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH which is the case if openssh is added as a feature/capability to windows
# However, notice the new path is not in PATH as is the cases with system variant, so it needs to be added manually.
# finally, ssh config files are always @ "$env:ProgramData\ssh" irrespective of installation method.
# if ssh key is created on windows, it doesn't work on linux and gives a cryptlib error. It must be read again and saved in non DOS format.
